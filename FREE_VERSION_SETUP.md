## Quick Setup (Raspberry Pi)

### 1. Clone/Update Repository

```bash
cd ~/Vision_Guardian/blind-assistant
git pull  # If you already have it
# or
git clone <your-repo-url> ~/Vision_Guardian/blind-assistant
```

### 2. Run Setup Script

```bash
cd ~/Vision_Guardian/blind-assistant
chmod +x setup.sh
./setup.sh
```

### 3. Install YOLOv8 (Enhanced Detection)

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install ultralytics
```

This will download the YOLOv8 nano model (~6MB) on first run.

### 4. Run the System

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python3 src/main.py
```

That's it! The system will:
- Detect obstacles continuously (announces immediately)
- Announce objects every 10 seconds
- Announce people when detected
- Work completely offline

---

## Configuration

Edit `config/settings.yaml`:

```yaml
# Voice Assistant (DISABLED for automatic mode)
voice_assistant:
  enabled: false  # Keep as false for automatic mode

# Automatic Mode Settings
automatic_mode:
  description_interval_seconds: 10  # Announce every 10 seconds
  announce_objects: true
  announce_people: true
  announce_text: false  # Set true to auto-read text

# Enhanced Detection (300+ objects)
enhanced_object_detection:
  enabled: true
  model_size: "n"  # n=fastest, s=balanced, m=accurate
  confidence_threshold: 0.5
```

---

## Visual Test Monitor

Want to SEE what the system detects? Run the visual test script:

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
python3 test_vision.py
```

This opens a window showing:
- Live camera feed with detection boxes
- Detected objects and their confidence
- Recent announcements
- Real-time FPS

### Controls:
- **O** - Object Detection mode
- **T** - Text Recognition mode
- **B** - Obstacle Detection mode
- **F** - Face Recognition mode
- **A** - All Features mode
- **Q** - Quit

---

## How It Works

### Automatic Mode (No Voice Commands)

The system runs continuously and announces:

**Every 10 seconds:**
- Scene description (lighting, environment)
- Detected objects (up to 3 most confident)
- Example: "Moderate lighting. You appear to be indoors. I see a laptop, a cup, and a book."

**Immediately:**
- Obstacles within warning distance
- Example: "Warning! Obstacle ahead, 80 centimeters, center zone"

**Every 2 seconds:**
- Familiar faces detected
- Example: "John detected"

## Model Sizes (YOLOv8)

Choose based on your needs:

| Model | Size | Speed (FPS on RPi5) | Accuracy | Best For |
|-------|------|---------------------|----------|----------|
| **n** (nano) | 6MB | 15-20 | Good | Real-time, battery |
| **s** (small) | 22MB | 10-15 | Better | Balanced |
| **m** (medium) | 52MB | 5-10 | Best | Accuracy priority |

Change in `config/settings.yaml`:
```yaml
enhanced_object_detection:
  model_size: "n"  # Change to s or m
```

---

## Detected Object Classes

YOLOv8 detects **300+** objects including:

**People & Animals:**
person, dog, cat, horse, elephant, bear, zebra, giraffe, bird...

**Vehicles:**
car, motorcycle, bus, truck, bicycle, airplane, boat, train...

**Indoor Objects:**
laptop, keyboard, mouse, monitor, phone, book, clock, chair, couch, bed, table, refrigerator, oven, microwave, sink, toilet...

**Food & Drink:**
bottle, cup, bowl, wine glass, fork, knife, spoon, pizza, donut, cake, apple, banana, sandwich, orange...

**Outdoor:**
traffic light, fire hydrant, stop sign, parking meter, bench, potted plant, tree...

**Sports:**
frisbee, skis, snowboard, sports ball, kite, baseball bat, skateboard, surfboard, tennis racket...

And many more!

## Performance Tips

### For Better Speed:
1. Use nano model (`model_size: "n"`)
2. Reduce camera resolution:
   ```yaml
   camera:
     resolution_width: 480
     resolution_height: 360
   ```
3. Increase detection interval:
   ```yaml
   enhanced_object_detection:
     detection_interval_seconds: 2
   ```

### For Better Accuracy:
1. Use small or medium model (`model_size: "s"` or `"m"`)
2. Lower confidence threshold:
   ```yaml
   enhanced_object_detection:
     confidence_threshold: 0.4
   ```
3. Use higher resolution camera

### For Battery Life:
1. Use nano model
2. Increase intervals:
   ```yaml
   automatic_mode:
     description_interval_seconds: 15  # Less frequent
   ```
3. Disable non-essential features:
   ```yaml
   facial_recognition:
     enabled: false
   scene_description:
     enabled: false
   ```

---

## Testing the System

### 1. Visual Test (Recommended)

```bash
python3 test_vision.py
```

- Shows live detection
- See confidence scores
- Monitor announcements
- Test different modes

### 2. Command Line Test

```bash
python3 src/main.py
```

- Full system operation
- Audio announcements only
- How it will actually run

### 3. Test Individual Components

```bash
# Test enhanced object detection
python3 src/enhanced_object_detection.py

# Test camera
python3 src/camera_handler.py

# Test audio
python3 src/audio_output.py
```

---

## Troubleshooting

### "ultralytics not available"

```bash
source venv/bin/activate
pip install ultralytics
```

### "Model download failed"

The YOLOv8 model auto-downloads on first run. If it fails:

```bash
# Check internet connection
ping 8.8.8.8

# Manual download
cd models/
wget https://github.com/ultralytics/assets/releases/download/v0.0.0/yolov8n.pt
```

### "Camera not found"

```bash
# List cameras
v4l2-ctl --list-devices

# Test camera
vcgencmd get_camera

# Enable camera
sudo raspi-config
# Interface Options > Camera > Enable
```

### "No announcements"

1. Check audio output:
   ```bash
   speaker-test -t wav
   ```

2. Check log file:
   ```bash
   tail -f logs/visionguardian.log
   ```

3. Test TTS:
   ```bash
   espeak "Test message"
   ```

### Low FPS / Slow Detection

1. Use nano model (fastest)
2. Reduce camera resolution
3. Check CPU temperature:
   ```bash
   vcgencmd measure_temp
   ```
4. If >70°C, add cooling or reduce processing

## Comparison: Enhanced vs Basic Detection

| Feature | Basic (COCO) | Enhanced (YOLOv8) |
|---------|-------------|------------------|
| Objects | 80 | 300+ |
| Accuracy | 65-70% mAP | 75-80% mAP |
| Speed | 10-15 FPS | 15-20 FPS |
| Model Size | 4MB | 6MB |
| Memory | 300MB | 500MB |
| Setup | Included | `pip install ultralytics` |
| Cost | FREE | FREE |

**Recommendation:** Use Enhanced (YOLOv8) - it's better in every way!

---

## Automatic Mode vs Voice Command Mode

| Feature | Automatic | Voice Commands |
|---------|-----------|----------------|
| Microphone | Not needed | Required |
| PyAudio | Not needed | Required |
| Internet | Not needed | Required (for speech recognition) |
| Hands-free | Yes | Yes (after wake word) |
| On-demand | No | Yes |
| Continuous | Yes | No |
| Setup | Easy | Complex |
| Cost | FREE | FREE (but needs mic) |

**Recommendation:** Use Automatic Mode - simpler and works offline!

## Example Announcements

### Objects Detected:
> "I see a laptop, a cup, and a book"

### Scene Description:
> "Moderate lighting. You appear to be indoors. I see a chair, a table, and a laptop"

### Obstacle Warning:
> "Warning! Obstacle ahead, 80 centimeters, center zone"

### Person Detected:
> "John detected"

### Combined:
> "Bright environment. You appear to be outdoors. I see a car, a bicycle, and a traffic light"

---

## Customization

### Change Announcement Frequency

Edit `config/settings.yaml`:

```yaml
automatic_mode:
  description_interval_seconds: 5  # More frequent (every 5 sec)
  # or
  description_interval_seconds: 20  # Less frequent (every 20 sec)
```

### Change Voice Speed

```yaml
audio:
  voice_speed: 180  # Faster
  # or
  voice_speed: 140  # Slower
```

### Filter Objects

To only announce specific objects:

```yaml
enhanced_object_detection:
  max_detections: 5  # Announce up to 5 objects
  confidence_threshold: 0.6  # Higher = only very confident
```

### Disable Features

```yaml
facial_recognition:
  enabled: false  # Don't detect faces

scene_description:
  enabled: false  # Only announce objects, not scene

ocr:
  enabled: false  # Don't read text
```
