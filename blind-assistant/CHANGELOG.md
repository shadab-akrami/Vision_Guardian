All notable changes to VisionGuardian will be documented in this file.

## [1.0.0] - 2024

### Initial Release

Complete smart wearable assistant system for visually impaired users, optimized for Raspberry Pi 5.

#### Core Features

- **Facial Recognition**: Real-time face detection and recognition with training system
- **Object Detection**: TFLite-based detection supporting 80 object classes (COCO dataset)
- **OCR (Text Reading)**: Tesseract-based text recognition with preprocessing
- **Scene Description**: Environmental context analysis with lighting and location inference
- **Obstacle Detection**: Real-time obstacle detection with distance estimation
- **Currency Detection**: Bill/coin recognition framework
- **Color Detection**: Dominant color identification using K-means clustering
- **Voice Assistant**: Wake word activation with command processing
- **Audio Output**: Priority-based TTS announcement system
- **Storage Management**: Intelligent cleanup for 32GB SD card constraints

#### Technical Implementation

- **Architecture**: Modular design with 14 core modules
- **Threading**: Multi-threaded processing with priority system
- **Performance**: Optimized for Raspberry Pi 5 ARM64 architecture
- **Configuration**: 100+ configurable parameters via YAML
- **Storage**: Automatic cleanup and optimization for 32GB cards
- **Logging**: Comprehensive logging with automatic rotation

#### Tools & Utilities

- **setup.sh**: Automated installation script (20-30 minutes)
- **train_faces.py**: Facial recognition training tool
- **calibrate.py**: Camera and audio calibration utility
- **benchmark.py**: Performance testing suite
- **download_models.sh**: Model management script

#### Documentation

- **README.md**: Comprehensive user guide (400+ lines)
- **QUICKSTART.md**: 15-minute quick start guide
- **INSTALL.md**: Detailed installation instructions
- **PROJECT_OVERVIEW.md**: Technical architecture documentation
- **LICENSE**: MIT license with safety disclaimer

#### Performance Targets

- Camera capture: 15+ FPS
- Object detection: 10-15 FPS
- Facial recognition: <1 second per detection
- OCR processing: <2 seconds per frame
- Total storage: <25GB usage
- Memory usage: 1.5-2GB RAM

#### Dependencies

- Python 3.11+
- OpenCV 4.8+ (ARM64 optimized)
- TensorFlow Lite Runtime
- Tesseract OCR
- face_recognition library
- pyttsx3 for text-to-speech
- SpeechRecognition for voice commands

#### System Requirements

- Raspberry Pi 5 (4GB or 8GB RAM)
- 64-bit Raspberry Pi OS (Bookworm or later)
- 32GB microSD card (Class 10+)
- USB Webcam
- Audio output device
- Internet connection (for setup and voice recognition)

#### Voice Commands

- "Hey Guardian" - Wake word
- "Read text" - OCR text reading
- "What do you see" - Scene description
- "Who is here" - Face identification
- "What color" - Color detection
- "Identify money" - Currency detection
- "Any obstacles" - Obstacle check
- "Help" - List commands
- "Repeat" - Repeat last announcement
- "Stop" - Stop announcements

#### Known Limitations

- Currency detection uses basic heuristics (custom model recommended)
- Scene description is rule-based (ML model recommended)
- Distance estimation requires calibration
- Voice recognition requires internet (Google Speech API)
- Performance varies with ambient conditions

#### Safety Features

- Conservative distance estimates
- Priority-based alert system
- Emergency interruption support
- Comprehensive safety disclaimers
- Not a replacement for traditional mobility aids
